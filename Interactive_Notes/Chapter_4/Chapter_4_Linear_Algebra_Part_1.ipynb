    "\n",
    "You cannot learn too much linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every mathematician\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding comment says it all - linear algebra is the most important of all of the mathematical tools that you can learn as a practitioner of the mathematical sciences. The theorems, proofs, conjectures, and big ideas in almost every other mathematical field find their roots in linear algebra. Our goal in this chapter is to explore numerical algorithms for the primary questions of linear algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "- solving systems of equations,\n",
    "- approximating solutions to over-determined systems of equations, and\n",
    "- finding eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs for a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see an introductory video to this chapter go to https://youtu.be/S190SQBoNg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take careful note, that in our current digital age numerical linear algebra and its fast algorithms are behind the scenes for wide varieties of computing applications. Applications of numerical linear algebra include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- determining the most important web page in a Google search,\n",
    "- determine the forces on a car during a crash,\n",
    "- modeling realistic 3D environments in video games,\n",
    "- digital image processing,\n",
    "- building neural networks and AI algorithms,\n",
    "- and many many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, researchers have found provably optimal ways to perform most of the typical tasks of linear algebra so most scientific software works very well and very quickly with linear algebra. For example, we have already seen in Chapter 3 that programming numerical differentiation and numerical integration schemes can be done in Python with the use of vectors instead of loops. We want to use vectors specifically so that we can use the fast implementations of numerical linear algebra in the background in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, a comment on notation. Throughout this chapter we will use the following notation conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A bold mathematical symbol such as $\\boldsymbol{x}$ or $\\boldsymbol{u}$ will represent a vector.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two bold symbols separated by a centered dot such as $\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}$ will represent the dot product of two vectors.\n",
    "- A capital mathematical symbol such as $A$ or $X$ will represent a matrix\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The juxtaposition of a capital symbol and a bold symbol such as $A \\boldsymbol{x}$ will represent matrix-vector multiplication.\n",
    "- A lower case or Greek mathematical symbol such as $x, c$, or $\\lambda$ will represent a scalar.\n",
    "- The scalar field of real numbers is given as $\\mathbb{R}$ and the scalar field of complex numbers is given as $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
