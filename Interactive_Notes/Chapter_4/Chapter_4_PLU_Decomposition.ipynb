    "However, not all matrices can be decomposed easily without **row swapping**. Sometimes, the pivot (the number we divide by during elimination) is zero or nearly zero, and **swapping rows** is necessary for correctness and numerical stability.\n",

    "To handle this, we introduce a **permutation matrix** $P$, so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
