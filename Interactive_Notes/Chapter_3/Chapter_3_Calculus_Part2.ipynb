There are many others, but in practice these two are relatively easy to implement and have reasonably good error approximations. To motivate the idea of the Trapezoid rule consider Figure 3.6. It is plain to see that trapezoids will make better approximations than rectangles at least in this particular case. Another way to think about using trapezoids, however, is to see the top side of the trapezoid as a secant line connecting two points on the curve. As $\\Delta x$ gets arbitrarily small, the secant lines become better and better approximations for tangent lines and are hence arbitrarily good approximations for the curve. For these reasons it seems like we should investigate how to systematically approximate definite integrals via trapezoids.\n",
